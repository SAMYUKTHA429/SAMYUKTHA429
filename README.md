📚 URBAN PLANNING AND DESIGN PROJECT VISION

The vision of urban planning and design is a forward-looking framework that guides the development of cities to be sustainable, livable, inclusive, and resilient, using strategic planning, innovative technologies, and efficient land use to improve the quality of life for all citizens and support future growth.

✏️FEATURE OF THE PROJECT :

Real-Time IoT Data Collection : ->Sensors for traffic, air quality, noise levels, and temperature. ->Continuous data monitoring for smart decision-making.
Visualization Dashboard: ->Live graphs and maps showing urban metrics. ->Heatmaps for congestion, pollution, and population density.
Land Use Simulation: ->Tools to simulate future land use scenarios. ->Supports zoning analysis and space optimization.
Traffic Flow and Congestion Analysis: ->Simulates vehicular movement using real-time data. ->Predicts congestion points and suggests alternate routes.
Green Space & Environmental Analysis ->Measures accessibility to parks and green zones. ->Evaluates environmental quality by region.
Infrastructure Planning ->Layout suggestions for roads, utilities, and public services. ->Ensures sustainable and inclusive infrastructure design.
💡TECHNOLOGY USED :

Language Used :

Python ->The entire script is written in Python, which is widely used for data analysis, simulation, and visualization. Libraries Used :
Pandas ->Used for creating and managing tabular data (DataFrame) like zone metrics.
NumPy ->Used for generating random data to simulate environmental metrics. ->np.random.randint(), np.random.uniform()
Matplotlib ->Used to create line plots for visualizing AQI, traffic, and noise levels across zones.
Folium (and folium.plugins.MarkerCluster) ->used to show data points on real maps in future improvements. Tools used :
Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook : Ideal environment for running this code due to display() and visualization support.
CSV File Export : The urban_df.to_csv() function saves simulated data to a .csv file, useful for reports or further analysis.
📌 Purpose of project :

The code simulates and visualizes real-time environmental and traffic data for different zones in a city to support urban planning decisions.

✒️ Working Steps:

->Zone Setup: Five city zones are defined with latitude and longitude. ->Data Simulation: For each zone, the code randomly generates: * Air Quality Index (AQI) * Traffic density * Noise level * Temperature * Humidity -> Data Storage: All generated data is stored in a pandas DataFrame and displayed. -> CSV Export: The data is saved to a file named final_urban_planning_data.csv. -> Visualization: A line plot is created using Matplotlib to show and compare AQI, traffic, and noise for each zone.

📂 Data collection :

   The dataset is simulated/generated programmatically using the numpy library's random functions.
